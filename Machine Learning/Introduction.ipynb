    "* Machine learning in general is the study of statistical computer algorithms that improve automatically through data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This means unlike typical computer algorithms that rely on human input for what approach to take, ML algorithms infer the best approach from the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning is a subset of AI and is not explicitly programmed on which decisions to make. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead the algorithm is designed to infer from the data the most optimal choices to make. \n"
